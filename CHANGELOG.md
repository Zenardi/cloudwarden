## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Phase 0 — Scaffold:** project layout, `pyproject.toml` (Ruff + pytest),
  `Makefile`, `.env.example`, Docker Compose (TimescaleDB + backend + Grafana,
  frontend behind a profile), Chainguard nonroot backend image.
- **Config / auth / resilience:** `config.py` (pydantic-settings), `auth.py`
  (read + write `DefaultAzureCredential`, ARM token), `resilience.py`
  (retry/backoff honoring `Retry-After`/`x-ms-ratelimit-*` + last-good cache).
- **Phase 1 — MVP cost pipeline:** Resource Graph inventory + Cost Management
  collectors (mock-backed via fixtures), storage layer (SQLAlchemy models +
  repository + Timescale/views bootstrap), orchestrator, Typer CLI
  (`initdb | run | run --mock | api | scheduler`), Grafana provisioning + Cost
  dashboard.
- **Phase 2 — Metrics + rules engine:** Azure Monitor metrics + Log Analytics
  memory + Advisor collectors (mock-backed), utilization rollups (avg/p95/max +
  data_completeness), FinOps rules (shutdown / downsize / idle-orphan) with
  Retail-Prices-based savings and Advisor confidence boosting, prioritized
  recommendations persisted, and a **Recommendations & Savings** Grafana dashboard.
- **Phase 3 — Pluggable AI layer:** provider abstraction (`AIProvider`) with a
  deterministic offline Stub, Anthropic (`claude-opus-4-8`, adaptive thinking,
  strict-JSON + tolerant parse), and OpenAI-compatible (local/Ollama/vLLM)
  providers — config-selected with a safe fallback so AI is best-effort.
  Aggregated + sanitized payload, executive summary persisted to `ai_summaries`,
  `/api/summary` endpoint, and an AI-summary panel on the Recommendations dashboard.
