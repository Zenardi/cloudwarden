"""Fire notifications for a binding's violations (M8.4).

Ties the M8.1–M8.3 machinery to bindings. A binding may carry one or more
``binding_notifications`` — each a (channel, template) pair. When a binding run
records a violation (a policy match), :func:`dispatch_for_binding` renders each
paired template from the violation context and dispatches it through the transport
selected by the channel's ``transport`` kind. A binding with **no** attachments
dispatches nothing.

The transport is resolved by :func:`build_transport` (a small registry over the
concrete transports), but every call site can pass a ``transport_factory`` — the
test seam — so unit tests inject a spy and nothing touches the network. Dispatch is
best-effort at the call site (see :mod:`azure_finops.custodian.bindings`): a failed
notification must never break the enforcement run that triggered it.
